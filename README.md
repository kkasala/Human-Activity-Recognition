# Human-Activity-Recognition

This project explores the enhancement of human-technology interaction through advanced human activity recognition using smartphone sensor data. Motivated by the increasing demand for efficient and reliable activity recognition in mobile ap- plications, this study utilizes a comprehensive dataset collected from 30 volunteers who performed six typical activities, capturing high-dimensional sensor data via smartphones. The methodology hinges on deploying several robust ML algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost) to classify activities ac- curately. This approach leverages feature engineering and dimensional reduction techniques to improve model performance and computational efficiency. The results demonstrate significant advancements in accuracy and processing time compared to existing models, underscoring the potential of machine learning in real-world appli- cations like health monitoring and interactive gaming. These findings open avenues for future research into more complex activity recognition and real-time processing scenarios.
